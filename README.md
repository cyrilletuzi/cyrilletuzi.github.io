# JavaScript guides

Web development is in a difficult situation : in the last 20 years, (almost) nobody really learned vanilla JavaScript. Eventually, some developers did some quick-and-dirty small animations with jQuery, and that's it. But surprise ! Everything is now converging towards JavaScript : rich and complex user interfaces in classic websites, mobile and tablet app development, even desktop software development, 3D games and soon virtual reality.

So we moved at once from no JavaScript needed to high level JavaScript everywhere. And as a web trainer, I see (as an example) more and more PHP or Java developpers coming to Angular 2 courses with no solid basics in HTML, CSS & JavaScript (and we just have 3 days to learn everything). It's like starting Symfony development without knowing PHP. And I'm not even talking of modern JavaScript (ES6) and modern HTML5 & CSS3 (ever heard of flex positionning ?).

So I decided to publish some guides to help learning modern HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

Hopefully, JavaScript basics are quite the same as other languages. So I wrote comparison guides to help switching from PHP or Java to JavaScript or TypeScript. Be aware that these guides do not explain the features, neither in PHP / Java nor in JavaScript / TypeScript. They use the current standard of JavaScript, i.e. ES6 (also known as ES2015).

HTML5 & CSS3 essentials guide for app development and other comparison guides coming soon.
