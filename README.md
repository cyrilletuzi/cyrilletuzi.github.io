# JavaScript guides

Web development is in a difficult situation : in the last 20 years, (almost) nobody really learned vanilla JavaScript. Eventually, some developers did some quick-and-dirty small animations with jQuery, and that's it. But surprise ! Everything is now converging towards JavaScript : rich and complex user interfaces in classic websites, mobile and tablet app development, even desktop software development, 3D games and soon virtual reality.

So we moved at once from no JavaScript needed to high level JavaScript everywhere. And as a web trainer, I see (as an example) more and more PHP or Java developers coming to Angular 2 courses with no solid basics in HTML, CSS & JavaScript (and we just have 3 days to learn everything). It's like starting Symfony development without knowing PHP. And I'm not even talking of modern JavaScript (ES6) and HTML5 & CSS3 (ever heard of flex positioning ?).

So I decided to publish some guides to help learn modern HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
