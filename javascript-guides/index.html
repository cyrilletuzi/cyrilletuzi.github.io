            <p>Web development is in a difficult situation : in the last 20 years, (almost) nobody really learned vanilla JavaScript.
                Eventually, some developers did some quick-and-dirty small animations with jQuery, and that's it.
                But surprise ! Everything is now converging towards JavaScript : rich and complex user interfaces in classic websites,
                mobile and tablet app development, even desktop software development, 3D games and soon virtual reality.
            </p>

            <p>So we moved at once from no JavaScript needed to high level JavaScript everywhere. And as a web trainer, 
                I see (as an example) more and more PHP or Java developpers coming to Angular 2 courses with no solid basics in HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript 
                (and we just have 3 days to learn everything).
                It's like starting Symfony development without knowing PHP. And I'm not even talking of <i>modern</i> JavaScript (ES6) 
                and HTML5 &amp; CSS3 (ever heard of flex positionning ?).</p>

            <p>So I decided to publish some guides to help learning modern HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Hopefully, JavaScript basics are quite the same as other languages. So I wrote comparison guides to help  
                switching from PHP or Java to JavaScript or TypeScript. 
                Be aware that these guides just <i>compare</i> the languages features, they do <i>not</i> explain them. 
                The current standard of JavaScript, i.e. ES6 (also known as ES2015), is used.</p>

            <h2><a href="php-to-javascript.html">PHP to JavaScript guide</a></h2>

            <p>HTML5 &amp; CSS3 essentials guide for app development and other comparison guides coming soon.</p>
